# DailyGit 
An app that gives users information about their GitHub contributions at a
glance. Also provides daily reminders to commit. 

## Inspiration 
My new year's resolution was to commit to GitHub every single day. Making a
habit out of coding has helped me accelerate the learning process. However, I do
still miss some days, so I created this app to help remind me (and hopefully
others as well) to code everyday.
